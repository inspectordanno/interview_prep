What makes a good hash?

1. Fast (constant time)
2. Doesn't cluster outputs at specific indices, but distributes uniformly
3. Deterministic (same input yields same output)

Hash function

1. Converts keys into valid array indices
2. Takes an input of variable size and converts it to hash of constant size

Collisions

1. Separate Chaining
  a. With separate chaining, at each index in our array we store values using a more sophisticated data structure (i.e. array or linked list)

2. Linear Probing
  a. With linear probing, when we find a collision, we search through the array to find the next empty slot
  b. Unlike with separate chaining, this allows us to store a single key-value at each index
